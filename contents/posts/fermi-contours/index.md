## Streamlining Python Package Development with Cookiecutter Hypermodern Python

Upholding best practices when developing a Python package can be overwhelming, but a template that handles most of the boilerplate code can be a lifesaver. In this blog post, I demonstrate this approach using my package, 'Fermi Contours'.

### Automating the Hard Parts

The Cookiecutter Hypermodern Python template automates several crucial aspects of Python package development:

- **Automated Documentation Deployment**: The template automatically deploys well-organized documentation to ReadTheDocs. For Fermi Contours, this means that the documentation, complete with tutorials and examples, is always up-to-date and accessible.

- **Automated Releases to PyPI**: The template simplifies releasing packages to PyPI. It handles versioning and distribution, allowing developers to focus more on development than on release management.

- **Continuous Integration and Testing**: With integrated GitHub Actions, every commit ensures the quality and stability of the code through automated tests and builds.

### Rich Documentation and Badges

Fermi Contours benefits significantly from rich documentation and the inclusion of informative badges. These badges offer quick insights into various aspects of the package, such as test coverage, supported Python versions, license, and more, enhancing transparency and trust.

### Fermi Contours: A Use Case

Fermi Contours, a Python package for computing contours of custom functions, illustrates the practical application of this template. It showcases how developers can focus on the core functionality of their package, leaving concerns like documentation hosting and release management to the automated processes of the template.

## Conclusion

The Cookiecutter Hypermodern Python template represents a significant leap forward in Python package development. It brings efficiency, consistency, and quality to the process, as evidenced by the development of Fermi Contours.
